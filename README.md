## Project
This is the mobile app built on [Unity](https://unity.com/) to commemorate the launch of the MudMud Art Studio and its inagural exhibition in Paris. MudMud commissioned [Rendergon](https://rendergon.com/portfolio/mudmudarstudio/)  to produce this augmented reality (“AR”) mobile application and released it in December 2018. The AR application enabled MudMud Studio prototype certain art items and its clients view a selection of the collection in 3D in their preferred location.

The released iOS app was removed from the Apple app store in 2022. This iOS repository is a fully functional prototype development version, last verified in July 2022 for iOS 15.5 and device iphone 12 Max Pro. This repo is not maintained.

The Android production version of the app is available on the [Google app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Rendergon.MudMudAR_Art).

The 3D models and textures have been removed/altered to protect the artist's intellectual property rights.
